My attempt at creating a cv-application based on the project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/

Live preview: https://vancelott.github.io/cv-application/

Future ideas to implement:

Make it so that the CV can be downloaded as a .pdf file. A button to add more input fields, for other work experience/ courses etc. In addition to that, I want to make it so that the user can add a picture of his own.
